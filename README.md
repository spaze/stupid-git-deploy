# stupid-git-deploy

## Installation
1. Symlink `deploy` to `~/.local/bin` or similar
2. Symlink `git_ssh_wrapper` to `~/.local/bin` or similar
3. Create a symlink in `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions` named `deploy` that points to `deploy_bash_completion` â€“ the symlink's filename has to be `deploy`, otherwise the completion won't work.
